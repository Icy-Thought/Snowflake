* Introduction
# Insert screenshot here..

A simple neovim configuration I setup by using the default listed lua-configurations in the designated plugins + minor modifications done to the settings.

For the time being, it mostly consists of the default configurations for the installed plugins + modifications done by others (such as: nvimdots, lunarvim/nfs and abzcoding's lvim) placed in their respective files.

I do not intend to keep the settings from other configuration files, so for now it will look like this until I bother to make it more original.

* Sections
Safety feature has been defined in Ayu theme due to it being placed first in the list. Why? Because home-manager generates *ONE* large file containing all the plugin configurations written inside ~config/nvim~ -> no need to re-define it and create a non-useful boilerplate block.
#+begin_src lua
local function prequire(...)
    local status, lib = pcall(require, ...)
    if (status) then return lib end
    return nil
end
#+end_src
